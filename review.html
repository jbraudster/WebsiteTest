<h1>Review: Bit Blaster XL</h1>
<p>I purchased this game for little of nothing during a steam summer sale.  I bought so many games during this last steam sale that I haven't had time to play half of them.  Yet somehow I've spent more time playing Bit Blaster XL than all of the other games combined.  I'll try to slog through the vast library of games I've recently purchased faltering, just to fall back to playing Bit Blaster XL for just some good old fashioned fun.</p>

<h3>Gameplay Mechanics</h3>
<p>This game is pretty simple.  You fly around a ship in a limited 2d space and are bombarded by enemies, 
asteroid-esque  thingamabobs, and power-ups.  The controls are pretty much like Asteroids.  You can turn 
your ship left and right.  You can slow down or speed up but you cannot stop.  The game also just keeps 
shooting unless you turn this option off.  I turned it off after my first game mostly because the game 
also has an ammo system.  You have a max of 100 ammo and each of the power-ups changes your weapon.  
Each weapon uses a different amount of ammunition.  Each enemy drops a pick-up that replenishes your ammo 
by 5.  So managing your ammo becomes a little bit of a hassle.  Luckily you can pick up a power-up and
 your ammo will completely fill for the new weapon.</p>

<p>The controls are pretty tight although incredibly simple.  Normally when I die I see what 
I did wrong and slowly learn what not to do next time.  I’ve been using a controller mostly because
 I recently tore my Achilles tendon.  The game is so simple to control that several of the controls 
 are redundant.  Many of the buttons do the same thing.</p>

<p>Gameplay  Mechanics – 7/10</p>
<h3>Level Design / Content</h3>
<p>There isn’t really much level design at first glance, but the game does a good job of enticing you 
with what content there is.  New enemies are slowly introduced as you progress further in the game.  
As far as I can tell, all power-ups are available from the beginning of the game.  Yet just with the throttling of enemies, I always felt the need to progress.</p>

<p>This is one of the few mobile games ported to pc that was not readily apparent to me (it definitely should have been).  I suppose when you buy something for a dollar you can forgive the lack of content.  Still just considering the amount of content I cannot justify to high of a score.</p>

<p>Level Design / Content – 6/10</p>
<h3>Art Style / Sound Design</h3>
<p>While there is not a whole lot of either of these things, what is there is golden.  The art style goes for the 8-bit style that is super simple but I feel it doesn’t detract from the experience.  I feel it doesn’t really add too much to the experience either.</p>

<p>The music slowly changes as the game progresses.  It slowly gets more busy and maybe even a little more frantic to match the quickening pace of the game.  The sound effects match the 8-bit retro feel.  I feel most of the art and sounds do a good job of getting the point across without doing anything phenomenal.  It all feels pretty good.</p>

<p>Art Style / Sound Design – 7/10</p>
<h3>Impression</h3>
<p>The game really doesn’t have story, lore, or setting to speak of.  However I am overall impressed by the game and I like the 8-bit feel of the game.</p>

<p>Impression – 7/10</p>
<h3>Value</h3>
<p>The game cost me a dollar or less.   I would have paid much more than that for it.</p>

<p>Value – 10/10</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>I have booted it up several times over the past week just to play something for 15 to 30 minutes.  Some of these sessions lasted over an hour.  I have found that I will come back to it after playing one of the other Summer Steam Sales games that are usually hit or miss.  I tend to enjoy it each time.</p>

<p>I feel like this game would be and probably is one of the best mobile games.  It is good for instant fun and it is fairly engaging for small sessions.</p>
<h3>Final Score – 37/50</h3>
