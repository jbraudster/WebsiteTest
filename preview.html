<h1>Preview: Act of Aggression</h1>
<p>Act of Aggression was developed by Eugen Systems and published by Focus Home Interactive.  The game hearkens back to the good old days when the RTS genre was king.  The game released on September 2, 2015.  I had played the beta for about a month before the release, and I was really excited for this release.  With gameplay that reminds me of Command and Conquer: Generals, the game scratches an itch left for dead by the mainstream gaming.</p>

<h3>Gameplay Mechanics:  Interested/Enthralled</h3>
<p>The game features old school RTS gameplay that hits a sweet spot for me.  When one gives commands to the units by clicking somewhere on the map, the units respond promptly.  Perhaps not as snappy as Starcraft II, but still your units start making progress towards the given order pretty quickly.  The game does a pretty good job of simulating the movement of the different types of units.  Tanks and light vehicles will try to stick to roads when it makes sense, where they move more quickly.  Infantry make a bee-line towards their destination, moving through trees and over mountains. Infantry, being significantly slower than vehicles and much more fragile, usually need some sort of transportation to be effective offensively.  This necessity of transportation is more prominent in Act of Aggression than any other RTS I've played.</p>

<p>There are 3 asymmetric factions:   The US army, the Chimera, and the Cartel.  Not quite as asymmetrical as Starcraft but at least as much as much as the Command and Conquer series.  For the first time in the history of ever, the US army is not the uber-micro faction.  The US army is a blunt instrument, a very strong one.  Most of the US units is the best at what it does but only serves one purpose.  The Abrams tank just feels awesome to mass and roll over your opponent.  The Chimera have more jack of all trades units.  The Chimera Terminator unit is it's main battle tank unit.  It starts out mildly effective against most things but hard to trade evenly with it because of its high special resource cost.  By the end of the game after all upgrades are purchased, the Terminator becomes quite effective against most things.  The Cartel specialize in stealth units.  They have just hit the beta at the time of writing so I have not had the chance to test them out properly.</p>

<p>The rock, paper, scissors gameplay is par for the course in this genre.  Infantry, Vehicles, and Air (including jets and helicopters) each have a unit that is effective or at least efficient against each other type of unit.  I found artillery to be a little too effective against tanks and infantry, but can be easily taken out by helicopters or ambushes and flanks.  Most of the units can be upgraded to an almost broken effectiveness.  For example, the US infantry Javelin unit starts out able to engage light vehicles and takes but would usually take several casualties in order to wipe out a substantial vehicle force unless garrisoned.  The NLOS, no line of sight or some nonsense, upgrade enables them to fire at much greater range able to lock on and arc to the target.  It seems to triple or quadruple the range.  This takes a unit that could be easily out-maneuvered and makes it a constant threat for vehicles.  If you consider that one javelin rocket can take out a Humvee and about 4 attacks can take out the slightly more armored Stryker.  The units seem to target the enemies that they are at least somewhat effective against.</p>

<p>The defensive options in this game are more effective than they have any right to be.  This forces the game into the endgame most of the time, which is fortunate because the game has nukes and they are satisfying to use.  The resource system is completely unique and innovative.  There are 3 resources:  money, aluminum, and rare earth.  Money can be made by garrisoning troops into banks, mining oil, and produced by POW's passively, as well as being generated by a certain buildings.  Aluminum is the early game limiting resource and can be produced by mining it and selling POW's for a lump sum.  Rare earth is used for end game upgrades, some special units, and nukes; it is produced the same way as aluminum but must be unlocked first.</p>

<p>Now having 3 different resources is not particularly unique, but the way these resources are used and produced in the game makes for interesting gameplay.  Money is to aluminum in AoA as minerals is to vespene gas in Starcraft.  Then rare earth adds an extra tier that is completely optional.  I have won pvp matches without ever investing in its production.  POW's that can be captured from enemy forces produce money when captured as long as you have space for them in your faction's special prisoner camp.  These POW's can also be consumed to give you a lump sum of either aluminium or rare earth.  At times I realized I desperately needed a technology so I would sell a prisoner for 1000 aluminum to get to that next tier.</p>
<h3>Level Design: Satisfied</h3>
<p>I seemed to babble on in the mechanics section, but I don't have too much to say about the level design.  The levels are all adequate.  All of the levels I have seen thus far are symmetrical to the point that your starting screen will look identical to your opponent's, if you have the same faction, because the game rotates the camera as well as the orientation of your buildings so that the opponent is north of you.  You are always fighting your way up to them.  This is pretty cool from a competitive stand point.  I hate being in the top right corner in Starcraft 2.  In this, you never have to.</p>

<p>The levels have a fair amount of detail.  One youtuber I was watching zoomed in and got side tracked by the number of actual real cars and trucks he found.  I think there was a Ford and a Buick in there among many others.</p>
<h3>Content: Interested</h3>
<p>I feel pretty good about the amount of content in the beta so far.  The game has enough different types of units that I usually feel like I can change up my strategy and try new things quite often, but doesn't have too many units that could cause the game experience to be less tight.</p>

<p>I go on and on about gameplay being tight because it's important to me.  If a game becomes too bloated without being designed properly a fair amount of the content becomes meaningless.  If a unit is not ever viable at some point even as a pocket strategy in an RTS game, then it should probably be reworked or removed if it is redundant but underpowered.</p>

<p>I cannot speak about the single player experience because it has not been released yet, but I hear that they have a Tom Clancy-esque story that deals with interesting, hypothetical real-world issues.
<h3>Art Style:  Interested</h3>
<p>The game is pretty.  Smoke trails and explosions feel satisfying and visceral.  The vehicles and environment look sufficiently detailed.  Infantry look a little wonky when you get to close so don't do that.</p>
<h3>Sound Design:  Satisfied</h3>
<p>The sound effects all sound pretty good and help to immerse you in the experience.  The music experience is a little weak.  The music is a blend of rock/metal/electronic.  Normal stuff for the genre.  Don't get me wrong the music sounds good.  It just never really helped to immerse me in the game.</p>
<h3>Impression:  Interested</h3>
<p>The game definitely has the old-school RTS feels.  So far I have enjoyed hours of playing against the AI and the occasional pvp match when I was feeling frisky.  Normally I would talk about the story here, but the game is still in beta and has no story released yet.  The gameplay of seeing your enemy has built rocks, trading in your scissors for paper, and tearing up his/her entire army of about 30 Abrams with 10 helicopters is incredibly satisfying.</p>

<p>I would recommend this game to anyone who likes old-school RTS games.  It is a must buy for those who are a fan of the Command and Conquer series.  I know I have certainly gotten my money's worth from the game and have yet to even play the single-player campaign.</p>

<p>Good luck and happy gaming!</p>
